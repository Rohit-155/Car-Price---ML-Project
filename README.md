Project Overview

Predicting the price of used cars using the data available of the cars. To extract useful insights from the dataset we need to manipulate & organise the data using Pandas & have to create a final datasets in which we can perform machine learning operations. Import Matplotlib & Seaborn library to visualize the data for better understanding. To improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting we need to import Scikit-learn. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms etc.
